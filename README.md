# Random Ayah CLI

Just a little thing I made to fetch a random Quran ayah from the Quran Cloud API. 

## Building

The project uses Meson because I was too lazy to type the GCC command every single time.

## Requirements

- `libcurl`
- `libjson-c`

## License

MIT - Because I am not responsible if the code launches a North Korean nuke at your house
